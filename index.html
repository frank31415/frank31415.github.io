	  <h3 class="center">Thomas Sowell quotes:</h3>
	  <p class="quote">"Socialism in general has a record of failure so blatant that only an intellectual could ignore or evade it."</p>
	  <p class="quote">"The first lesson of economics is scarcity: there is never enough of anything to fully satisfy all those who want it. The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics."</p>
	  <p class="quote">"Sometimes it seems as if there are more solutions than problems. On closer scrutiny, it turns out that many of today's problems are a result of yesterday's solutions."</p>
	  <p class="quote">"The real minimum wage is zero."</p>
